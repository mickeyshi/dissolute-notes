*FILLER*
**Major Humor:** Choleric
**Minor Trait:** Counsel/Charisma
**Personality:**  Paranoid, mistrustful, obsessive. Deeply aware of the failures of his predecessors, and wears their misdeeds around him like a noose that could pull loose at any moment. His dedication to the sport of kingship has isolated him from his family and friends, and his erstwhile son. Has actually pulled the finances of the kingdom from their slump. 

**Description:** Your benefactor all this time, the king sets you up with your laboratory and empowers you to do what must be done for the sake of the kingdom. Serves as a last line of defense in case people don't cooperate with your goals. Starts not trusting you before building it up, but can later break if you decide to go down the route of trying to help the demon homunculus. 

**Problem:** His obsession and paranoia - he wants to trust people again.

**Quotes: **

"The weight of power crushes the spine, but sharpens the nerves. "
