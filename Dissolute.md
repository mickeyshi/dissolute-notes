**Alternate Titles:** Higher Humors, What Makes a Man

**Summary**: Princess Maker type game where, instead of gaining experience via training, traits are their own qualities, taken from other people. Our protagonist trains a homunculus who starts off a blank slate, but is given Sight by our alchemist protagonist. The goal is to make her a fully fledged person.

**Traits**: Traits are distilled qualities of a person, that seep out from them under [[CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE DETERMINED.]] These consist of minor traits, like Endurance, Fleetness, and Bearing, which are statted and can be extracted from animals/environment over time, and major traits, like Understanding, Sight, and Kindness, which can only be given by someone willing to lose those traits in turn. The full list can be found under [[Dissolute Character Traits]].

Potential minor traits:
	- Endurance - ability to handle physical exertion, stamina tasks
	- Fleetness - ability to quickly react to stimuli
	- Bearing - comeliness, beauty
	- Reasoning - 
Potential major traits
	- Sight - ability to perceive, feel
	- Kindness - ability to emphasize, intuit emotion
	- Recollection - ability to remember
	- Desire - ability to have goals and wants, express them, and make plans to achieve them
	- Fear - ability to fear what comes next, anticipate death and pain. 
	- Self/Consciousness - the divine "spark" that turns her from a mortal thing to a god

**Structure**: Gameplay consists of grinding for minor traits, which in turn unlock more efficient ways to gather traits from new NPCs and areas, and predetermined story events that unlock major traits. Major traits will involve decision points, where you as the guardian choose whether you want to take the trait (perhaps leaving the NPC bereft of it - like a king wishing to lose his Kindness in order to be a better monarch) - or donate it from yourself. 

**Plot**: The world spins faster day by day, and traits leak from opened mouths of the weak and aging. You, as the royal alchemist in charge of the catastrophe, find hope in the shell of a homunculus, who can retain the traits lost by humanity. Your goal is to ascend her into godhood, such that she might correct the mistakes of yesteryear. 

Two scales in terms of determining ending - her willingness/aptitude as a god, and her attitude toward you and other people

**Scheduling:** You choose events for your homunculus to do. She can choose between character-building activities (where she may optionally ask someone out to tutor her for bonus experience), or working to solve the mystery of the world's ending. You also have access to your own schedule, which you can use to sync up playdates for a burst of

## Possible ideas for gameplay elements besides schedule management
**Minigames** 
	- Some sort of conveyor belt sushi clothing - pick the right one in 5 seconds
	- Diagnosis of folks that come in with symptoms - hook them up with prescriptions, you get dinged based on whether they come back. Could also link up with treating people that get trait-dissolution-itis - NPCs could show up before or after their treatment
	- Fake surgery a la Trauma Center?
	- Warioware minigames

Background elements
	- Can have small props like NPCs change in the background based off player context
